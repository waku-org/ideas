# Waku - Idea Board ðŸ’¡

Below is a compilation of innovative project ideas curated by the Waku community. These ideas cover a wide range of use cases and applications, showcasing the versatility and potential of the Waku protocol for decentralized, privacy preserving communication and beyond.

<br>

> Note : Numerous traditional chat applications have already harnessed Waku's capabilities. To truly innovate and avoid re-inventing the wheel, we encourage hackers to explore untapped possibilities and unique projects that integrate Waku in other novel ways apart from chat.

<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Polling/Voting</b></summary>
<br>
Enable polling or voting off-chain, vote results could be aggregated and submitted on-chain in one transaction.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Marketplace (buy/sell goods or NFTs, ride-share, llm, etc)</b></summary>
<br>
Send offer and negotiate off-chain. Highest bids sent over Waku could be binding and submitted to the contract by the seller.
This could include using Waku to enable LLM marketplace where several providers compete to be the one to generate a user's request.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Collaborative Editing</b></summary>
<br>
Use Waku for live collaborative editing of documents, saved versions of documents can then be stored on decentralized storage.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Multiplayer Games</b></summary>
<br>
Waku can be used to communicate game moves off-chain, the final state (e.g., winner) can then be submitted on-chain for a reward (e.g., NFT mint or winner takes stake).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>IoT Systems</b></summary>
<br>
Enable devices to communicate or report small data payloads in a decentralized manner.
This can be an interesting way for a government agency or health organization to collect data from the population to study, in a privacy preserving manner.
For example, indoor air quality sensors could be distributed to residents across a city.
The authentication for data push could be done using zk tech: zk credentials of a given device is added to a zk group for a postcode, when pushing data to Waku, zk proof is used so that agency can auth the data and assign it to the right area/postcode but individual indentification or IP harvesting cannot be done.
This can also become an open data initiative: anyone can collect the data from the Waku network for study (DeSci).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Decentralized Wallet Address Ownership Verification</b></summary>
<br>
Use Waku to enable communication between dApps and wallets, such as signature or zero-knowledge proof exchange to prove identity.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Notifications Centre</b></summary>
<br>
Use an SDK (probably go-waku?) to build a general Notification protocol over Waku and a mobile app allowing you to replace centralized Push Notifications provided by Apple/Google.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>API Generator</b></summary>
<br>
Build a tool to generate a Waku protocol (and code) from a provided OpenAPI specification.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Leader Election Protocol</b></summary>
